<h2> What is a Magellan Project? </h2>
<p> Magellans are grants given to students at Washington and Jefferson to complete research for an intended purpose. The information studied and knowledge learned is then created into a project after the trip and research is completed. </p>
<h2> My Magellan </h2>
<p> The purpose of my Magellan project was to have the opportunity to learn more about some of the Native American tribes that live within the United States. While I have had the opportunity to learn about many different cultures, I felt as if I lacked the knowledge I would like to have about so many groups of people that make up the country I grew up in. Therefore, in visiting these beautiful places, I was able to learn about the places that shaped their culture and learn about the challenges different tribes continue to face to this day in my research. </p>
<p> I have studied many different cultures throughout my 4 years of college. My German major introduced me to the culture of German speaking countries and while completing a semester abroad, I was able to immerse myself but also travel and learn about so many different places. I have also taken Russian classes that introduced me to another part of the world, but no matter how many cultures I have learned about in my classes, I still lack information about many that exist in the same country I live in. With this research grant, I hoped to change that, and I feel like I succeeded in learning a lot more about many different tribes in the areas I was able to visit. </p>
