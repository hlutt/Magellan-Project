<h2> Hidden Gem </h2>
<img class="aside" src="bcg2.jpg" width=95%  alt="Black Canyon of the Gunnsion photo">
<p>Black Canyon of the Gunnison is what I would consider to be a hidden gem in the world. This National Park is incredibly unpopulated in comparison to many other National Parks, but there is a uniqueness that I have never seen anywhere else. While the views of this protected land are extraordinary, they are even more spectacular as you descend into the canyons. The gorges and valleys that exist show that the terrain would not have been the easiest to navigate and survive in, but the Ute Indians inhabited this beautiful land nonetheless.</p>

<h2> Ute History </h2>
<img class="right" src=bcgbottom.jpg width=60% alt="Bottom of Black Canyon of the Gunnison">
<p class="section"> The Ute Indians are a tribe that was very monumental in the formation of present day Colorado. They inhabited areas such as Black Canyon of the Gunnison. With the dispersal of the tribe, there are several different reservations that were created leading to even more culture spreading throughout Colorado and the surrounding states. </p>
<h2> Uintah and Ouray Reservations</h2>
<p class="section"> These reservations were the first to form in 1864. This tribe sustained themselves through mineral extraction.</p>
<h2> Ute Mountain Reservation </h2> 
<p class="section"> Agriculture and construction were the key elements for this reservation. </p>
<h2> Southern Ute Reservation</h2>
<p class="section">Important parts of the economy are real estate and investments in energy. </p>
<p class="section">These reservations are in vastly different areas, but there are many similarities in the cultures they have kept in practice.</p>
