<h2> History Colorado </h2>
<p>While in Colorado, I had the ability to meet with Liz Cook at the History Colorado Center in Denver, Colorado where I was able to learn about different aspects of multiple Native American tribes that make up Colorado and had a profound impact on its creation. While in Montrose, Colorado I had to ability to visit the Ute Indian Museum and explore History Colorado's exhibit on the Ute Indians. History Colorado and the Ute Indian museum have wonderful exhibits on the Ute Indians that they created with input from members from the tribe. There were many consultations in the creation of the museum itself as well, along with a traveling kit that goes to different museums to educate people in different areas about the tribe.</p>
