<h2> Protected Areas </h2>
<p>As a National Recreation Site, Glen Canyon is a protected area with an important history, much of which is related to Native American life and has been for thousands of years. This expansive canyon ranges from around 500 feet deep at the base of Glen Canyon dam to nearly 6,000 feet at the deepest point, revealing the different layers of erosion and change over time with the different coloring on the rocks. With darker rocks being visible, it is shown that this land has existed for billions of years, but many petroglyphs exist within the rocks demonstrating the civilizations that existed long before the history that is commonly taught in schools</p>

<h2> Petroglpyh History </h2>
<img class="right" src=antpetro.jpg width=60% alt="Antelope Petroglyph">
<p>On a trip throughout Glen Canyon that traversed through Horseshoe Bend, Petrogylph Beach was one of the stops. Here, petroglyphs between 3,000 and 6,000 years old could be seen. Named the "Descending Sheep Panel", this petroglyph served as a way of communication and writing, potentially expressing prayers for the tribes that inhabited Glen Canyon during this time period. There are many different interpretations for this panel's meaning that have developed over time. Preserving these sites is very important as they are important in preserving Native American culture. </p>
<p> The Archeological Resources Protection Act protects areas such as these in order to preserve history, but also because these sites are important to cultures to this day. They are sacred sites that cannot be defaced, but in 2010 the "Descending Sheep Panel" was defaced by a tourist resulting in a $10,000 fine. As an irreplaceable part of culture, the etching of a tourist's name into the rock resulted in large consequences.  </p>
<p> Another petroglyph I had the opportunity to see on this trip was "The Birthing Panel" at Birthing Rock. The Abajo-La Style is demonstrated which consists of broad shouldered anthropomorphs with short arms. Many humans, animals, and linear geometric patterns made up these kinds of petroglyphs throughout the Archaic and Ute periods. The Formative Period's style is also demonstrated in this petroglyph with the sheep, snakes, and abstract shapes.</p>
