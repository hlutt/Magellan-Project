<h2> Petroglyphs </h2>

<p>Petroglyph Point is the name of the area in the park where petroglyphs written on the walls along the canyons can be seen. A 2.4 mile hike up the side of the canyons is necessary to reach this destination, and the hike highlights the extensive routes that were taken in the heat along steep cliff sides to travel from destinations in this civilization that existed such a long time ago in history. The creative architecture shows the innovativeness of the Pueblo people and the petroglyphs show a piece of the life that existed before our time.</p>

<h2>Puebloan History </h2>
<img class="right" src=mesaverde.jpg width=60% alt="Mesa Verde Cliff Palace">
<p class="section"> Puebloan tribes were one of the core groups of Native Americans that made up what is today Colorado. Mesa Verde National Park preserves those lands with many archaeological sites still in tact. As can be seen, there are cliff dwellings and structures that ancient Puebloan people lived everyday life in. Based on the knowledge learned at the park, this cliff dwelling would have housed 19 households which would have consisted of 60 to 80 people. </p>
<p class="section">Mesa Verde is still an important site for Pueblo people which is a fact that not many Americans are aware of. While these sites are protected and were ancestral lands, they are still significant in cultural practices and are "living places" for Pueblo people. They gather strength and resilience from their ancestors in these protected places that made up their history.</p>
